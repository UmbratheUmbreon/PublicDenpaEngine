-[Accuracy Modes] Maybe to you, the accuracy in base FNF doesn't cut it. Maybe you want some uber accurate accuracy system. Fortunately for you, hyperspecific person out there, Denpa Engine comes packaged with 2 accuracy modes to choose from, Simple and Complex! Complex is so accurate, it rivals other- (Our legal team has advised us to stop there).

And of course, all of Psych's 0.5.2h features (not 0.6+, that is GARBO)
